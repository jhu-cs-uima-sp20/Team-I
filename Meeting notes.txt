Design Review feedback from peers:
- Color scheme issues
- Too pastely, hard to see, etc.
- Background noise for voice part? Pitch? Range? Should iron out those issues
- Calibration page hard to understand
- Worked on redesigning the design 
- Added yellow to color theme, changed the blue, so less pastely
- Got rid of black 
- Fixed button and pop-up designs 
- Still need to redesign calibration page & finish revamping tutorial/instructions
- Maybe change coins to gems or sth?
